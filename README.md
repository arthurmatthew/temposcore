## About 💁‍♂️

Temposcore is an advanced metronome app that delivers a pleasant user experience and interface. You're able to create 
arrangements of metronomes so you stay in time throughout your whole piece, no matter the time changes. With feautures like 
adding ritardandos, you can practice like you're watching a conductor. *Of course, it's still very easy to play a simple metronome.*
